Problem Description
Given an integer num, return the number of digits in num that divide num.

An integer val divides nums if nums % val == 0

Example 1:

Input: num = 121 
Output: 2
Explanation: 121 is divisible by 1, but not 2. Since 1 occurs twice as a digit, we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: num = 1248 
Output: 4
Explanation: 1248 is divisible by all of its digits, hence the answer is 4.
Constraints:

1 <= num <=
1
0
9
10 
9
 
num does not contain 0 as one of its digits.

CODE IN C++

class Solution {
public:
    int countDigits(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        int originalNum = num;

        while (num != 0) {
            int digit = num % 10;
            if (digit != 0 && originalNum % digit == 0) {
                count++;
            }
            num /= 10;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
